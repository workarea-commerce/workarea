          rendering_help: This list is the "middleware" that Workarea uses to render searches. Each step of this chain can pass (do nothing), alter the search response, or declare "this search is done". In the right column, a down arrow indicates this step did nothing, it passed down to the next step. A checkbox indicates this step was the final one, and declared "I know how to respond". An X indicates this step didn't run, because a previous one decided it was final.

          ranking_help_html: This will illustrate how Workarea ranked the results. If there's a check in the Featured column, this result is here due to the Featured Products functionality available in the card above. The score comes from Elasticsearch's interal ranking system and Workarea's customization to that. It's based in an algorithm called TD/IDF.
