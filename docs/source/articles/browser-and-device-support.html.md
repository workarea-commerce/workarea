## System Emails

Responsive: YES

Emails were adapted from a community-supported, responsive template called [Cerberus](http://tedgoas.github.io/Cerberus/), which has been tested in a variety of email clients. Before any system email is sent it is first processed by a gem called [Premailer](https://github.com/premailer/premailer), which helps to standardize the way emails are customized. Minor changes like colors, fonts, and image sources should require only minimal testing in a web browser. Changes to layouts, new layouts, or other significant changes should be tested through a 3rd-party email testing service.
