# Translate Administrable Content

Many fields available through the Admin UI can be localized. These fields are indicated by a localization icon.

To set the value of these fields for a different locale, use the locale switcher at the top of the Admin screen.

Translations of administrable content are stored with [Mongoid-localized fields](https://docs.mongodb.com/mongoid/6.4/tutorials/mongoid-documents/#localized-fields).

**Note:** This functionality will appear only if more than one locale is configured on the `I18n` module.
