# Style Guides

Each Workarea user interface includes a style guide page that provides tests and documentation for each layer of the [CSS Architecture](/articles/css-architectural-overview.html). The only exception to this rule is Tools, who's documentation is included in their respective files. These pages are available by default at the following paths:

- `/style_guides`
- `/admin/style_guides`

## Documentation

A primary use case for the style guide pages is documentation for developers, managers, clients, and other stakeholders. Style guide pages provide a single page view of all "components" of a UI that are considered reusable.

## Test Suite

The other primary use case for the style guide pages is a test suite for developers. Many SIs develop most of the UI using only this page. It's much easier to develop and maintain re-usable components in one place rather than spread throughout the app. The page allows for visual testing, like confirming a `button` block looks the same regardless of the underlying HTML element.
