# Documentation Style Guide

Documentation contributions should uphold the following style rules.

## Voice

Write as an expert on the software, rather than one of its maintainers. This encourages contributions. For example, instead of “we decided to change…”, use “Workarea 3.3 changes…”.

## Titles & Headings

The title of each document and the heading of each document section should describe either a concept or the procedure to complete a task. Use _nouns_ for titles and headings that represent _concepts_. Use _verbs_ to represent _tasks_.

Capitalize the first word and important words.

Examples (concepts):

- Content
- Plugins
- Orders & Items
- Placing Orders

Examples (tasks):

- Add System Content
- Release a Plugin
- Export Orders
- Place an Order

Try to limit outline depth to three levels (h1-h3). If you find yourself needing a deeper outline, consider re-organizing the content into multiple documents.

## Proper Nouns

Names of software packages, such as _Admin_ and _Storefront_ are proper nouns, which are capitalized.

Names of features are _not_ proper nouns and are not capitalized. Examples:

- cart
- checkout
- Admin toolbar

## Spelling & Grammar

At this time there are no prescribed style rules regarding spelling, grammar, and language. However, always use a spell checker before submitting contributions.
