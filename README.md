[Workarea](https://www.workarea.com) is an enterprise-grade commerce platform written in [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org). It uses [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com), [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch), and [Redis](https://redis.io). Workarea also uses a whole lot of gems you can see in [our gemspec](https://github.com/weblinc/workarea/blob/master/core/workarea-core.gemspec).

Demo
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can run a demo version of workarea by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/workarea-commerce/workarea-demo/master/bin/install | bash
```

This will run a script that does the following:

* clone the [workarea-demo](https://github.com/workarea-commerce/workarea-demo) repository.
* build a Docker image for the application
* start containers for the application and required services
* seed the database
* start the application server

It requires you have Docker installed and running. Once complete, you can visit `http://localhost:3000` to view your app. The seed data provides an admin user with an email/password of `user@workarea.com/w0rkArea!`.

For more information on usage and troubleshooting, see the [workarea-demo](https://github.com/workarea-commerce/workarea-demo) page.

Getting Started
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We'll assume you have [Docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and [Ruby >= 2.4.0, < 2.7.0](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#installation) installed.

1. Add the `workarea` gem to the `Gemfile` in your Rails 5.2 app:

        gem 'workarea', '~> 3.4.6'

2. Install the gems:

        $ bundle install

3. Start the workarea services (uses Docker):

        $ bin/rails workarea:services:up

4. Run the Workarea Rails generator:

        $ bin/rails generate workarea:install

   This generator will mount the Workarea engines in `config/routes.rb`, and add Workarea seeds to `db/seeds.rb`.

5. Run the database seeds:

        $ bin/rails db:seed

5. Run the Rails server:

        $ bin/rails server

6. Visit `http://localhost:3000` in a browser and you'll see your Workarea storefront.
